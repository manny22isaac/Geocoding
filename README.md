# Automating Geocoding w/ Python & GoogleMaps API

This is a simple code snippet of how to use retreive coordinates from google.  

To have access to google's servers, you must set up a gmail account to use the google developer console to get the api key.

Then you must import the modules googlemaps, requests, and json.

When a request for a city is sent it will return a huge line of code, which can then be sorted out by making a call from lists.
